**Project Overview**

Working on a project to predict the direction a goalkeeper will dive during a penalty kick. The prediction will be based on the following input parameters:

* Team
* Kicker’s dominant foot
* Target zone of the shot
* Penalty number in the shootout
* Elimination stage of the competition

We aim to analyze relevant data and use it to predict the optimal zone for the goalkeeper to dive, increasing the chances of a save.

**Frontend Concept**

For the frontend, we plan to build a gamified penalty shootout experience. The user will be able to:

* Select a team
* Choose the kicker’s dominant foot
* Click on an interactive goal to select the shooting zone

Based on this input, our system will simulate the goalkeeper’s dive using our predictive model. The game will then show whether the shot was saved or scored, depending on the predicted dive direction.
