About Dataset
Context
This dataset was created because I wanted to analyze shooting tendencies in penalty shooting. It was built by watching every single penalty kick in a World Cup Shootout from Spain 1982 to Russia 2018.

Content
For each penalty I registered the following:

Kicking Team
Where the shot was taken. To do this, I divided the goal in 9 different zones.
Whether the shooter was left or right footed.
Where did the keeper dive.
Whether the shot was on target or not.
Whether the shot went in or not.
The penalty number in each series.
Whether or not the penalty was for elimination. This where the cases when, if the shot went in, the Game was over or the cases where a miss would end the game.
Notes
In the Zone column, I divided the goal into 9 different sections looking at it from the front:

Upper left corner
Upper center
Upper right corner
Middle left area
Middle center area
Middle right area
Bottom left corner
Bottom center zone
Bottom right corner
